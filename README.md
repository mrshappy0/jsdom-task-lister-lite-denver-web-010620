# Diet TaskLister™️

## Hello and Welcome to TaskLister Lite™️

Today you'll be creating a simple to do list application that will focus on DOM manipulation. Take a look at `index.html` before you write any code; think about which DOM elements you will grab input from, and which elements would be ideal to store information

Check out the [working demo](https://learn-co-curriculum.github.io/js-task-lister-lite/)

### Instructions:

1. Fork and clone this Repo. It is entirely behavior-driven so there will be no tests.
2. Open up `index.html` in Chrome. You can run `open index.html` from your terminal.
3. Put you JavaScript knowledge to the test and build out the desired functionality of this app: as a user, I should be able to type a task into the input field, submit the form, and see that task appear on the DOM.

### Stretch Goals:
If you finish early, try to implement one or more of the following:

- A delete function that will remove tasks from your list
- A priority value selected from a dropdown that is used to determine the color of the text in the list (e.g. red for high priority, yellow for medium, green for low)
	- As a nice challenge, try to a way to toggle a sort function that will sort the tasks by priority.
- An additional input field (e.g. user, duration, date due)
- Ability to edit tasks
- Something of your choice! The main objective is to add a feature that allows the user's input to affect the DOM.
