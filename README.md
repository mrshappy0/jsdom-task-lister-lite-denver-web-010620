#Diet TaskLister™️

##Hello and welcome to TaskLister Lite™️

Today you'll be creating a simple to do list application that will focus on DOM manipulation.

###Instructions:

1. Fork and clone this Repo. It is entirely behavior-driven so there will be no tests.
2. Open up `index.html` in Chrome
3. Put you JavaScript knowledge to the test and build out the desired functionality of this app: as a user, I should be able to type a task into the input field, submit the form, and see that task appear on the DOM.
4. If you finish this, try to implement a delete function on your tasks.
